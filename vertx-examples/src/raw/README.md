# Raw Verticle Examples

Subdirectories of this directory contain examples of using Vert.x in the form of *raw verticles*.

Raw verticles are basic verticles which are run directly at the command line using `vertx run`.

This is really useful for prototyping and demonstrating the Vert.x API, but for real Vert.x applications it's always
recommended to package your application as a module (or a set of modules).

For more information on this please consult the main manual and the modules manual on the Vert.x web-site.
