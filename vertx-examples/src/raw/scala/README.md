# Vert.x Raw Scala Verticle Examples

Prerequisites:

1) The bin directory from the distro must be on your PATH - this should have been done as part of the install procedure.

2) JDK/JRE 1.7.0+ must be installed and the JDK/JRE bin directory must be on your PATH

To deploy an example:

(for full help on deploying just type `vertx` from the command line)

    vertx run <example scala source file>

where <example scala source file> is, for example, `echo/EchoServer.scala`.

Note that we're running the Scala example by specifying the Scala *source* file, not the class file. This is cool feature of Vert.x - it will automatically compile Scala Source on demand.

Of course, you can also run compiled Scala classes with Vert.x by specifying the FQCN instead of the source file name. You'll also need to specify the classpath in that case.

*All examples should be run from this directory unless otherwise stated.*

There now follows a description of all the available examples:

## Echo Server + Client

A simple echo server which echos back any sent to it

To run the server:

    vertx run echo/EchoServer.scala

Then telnet localhost 8080 and notice how text entered via telnet is echoed back

Instead of telnet you can also run a simple echo client in a different console:

    vertx run echo/EchoClient.scala

## Fanout Server

Fans out all data received on any one connection to all other connections.

To run the server:

    vertx run fanout/FanoutServer.scala

Then telnet localhost 8080 from different consoles. Note how data entered in telnet is echoed to all connected connections

## HTTP

A simple HTTP server which just returns some hard-coded HTML to the client, and a simple HTTP client which sends a GET
request and displays the response it receives.

To run the server:

    vertx run http/Server.scala

Then point your browser at <http://localhost:8080>

Alternatively, you can also run the HTTP client in a different console:

    vertx run http/Client.scala

## HTTPS

Like the HTTP example, but using HTTPS

To run the server:

    vertx run https/ServerExample.scala

Then point your browser at https://localhost:4443

Alternatively, you can also run the HTTPS client in a different console:

    vertx run https/ClientExample.scala

You'll get a warning from your browser since the server certificate the server is using is not known to it, that's normal.

## Proxy

A very simple HTTP proxy which simply proxies requests/response from a client to a server and back again.

It includes

a) A simple http server which just takes the request and sends back a response in 10 chunks

b) A simple http client which sends a http request with 10 chunks (via the proxy server), and displays any
response it receives

c) A proxy server which simply sits in the middle proxying requests and responses between client and server

Do each part in a different console:

To run the http server:

    vertx run proxy/Server.scala

Run the proxy server:

    vertx run proxy/ProxyServer.scala

Run the http client:

    vertx run proxy/Client.scala

## PubSub

A very simple publish-subscribe server.

Connections can subscribe to topics and unsubscribe from topics. Topics can be any arbitrary string.

When subscribed, connections will receive any messages published to any of the topics it is subscribed to.

The pub-sub server understands the following simple text protocol. Each line is terminated by CR (hit enter on telnet)

To subscribe to a topic:

    subscribe,<topic_name>

To unsubscribe from a topic:

    unsubscribe,<topic_name>

To publish a message to a topic:

    publish,<topic_name>,<message>

Where:

`<topic_name>` is the name of a topic

`<message>` is some string you want to publish

To run the server:

    vertx run pubsub/PubSubServer.scala

Then open some more consoles and telnet localhost 8080, and experiment with the protocol.

## SendFile

Simple web server that uses `sendFile` to serve content directly from disk to the socket bypassing user space. This is a very efficient way of serving static files from disk.

The example contains three static pages: `index.html`, `page1.html` and `page2.html` which are all served using sendfile.

To run the server:

    vertx run sendfile/SendFileExample.scala

Then point your browser at <http://localhost:8080> and click around

## SSL

This is like the echo example, but this time using SSL.

To run the server:

    vertx run ssl/SSLServer.scala

To run the client in a different console:

    vertx run ssl/SSLClient.scala

## Upload

A simple upload server example. The client streams a file from disk to an HTTP request and the server reads the HTTP request and streams the data to a file on disk.

To run the server:

    vertx run upload/UploadServer.scala

To run the client in a different console:

    vertx run upload/UploadClient.scala

## Websockets

A simple example demonstrating HTML 5 websockets. The example serves a simple page which has some JavaScript in it
to create a websocket to a server and send and receive data from it.

The server just echoes back any data is receives on the websocket.

To run the server:

    vertx run websockets/WebsocketsExample.scala

Then point your browser at: <http://localhost:8080>

## Route Match

This example shows how a route matcher can be used with a vert.x HTTP server to allow REST-style resource based matching of URIS
in the manner of express (JS) or Sinatra.

To run the example:

    vertx run route_match/RouteMatchExample.scala

Then point your browser at: <http://localhost:8080>

An index page will be served which contains some links to urls of the form:

    /details/<user>/<id>

The server will extract the user and id from the uri and display it on the returned page

## SockJS

A simple example demonstrating SockJS connections from a browser. The example serves a simple page which has some JavaScript in it
to create a SockJS connection to a server and send and receive data from it.

It installs a simple SockJS application which simply echoes back any data received.

To run the server:

    vertx run sockjs/SockJSExample.scala

Then point your browser at: <http://localhost:8080>

## Resource Load

This example shows how you can access various resources on your classpath.

Run it with

    cd resourceload
    vertx run ResourceLoadExample.scala

## Event Bus Point to Point

This examples shows how to use the event bus to send point to point messages between different verticles, and how to
reply to messages.

A "ping!" message is sent every second by the Sender verticle. The Receiver verticle should receive it and send
back a "pong!"

Run the receiver and sender in different JVM instances. Since they are separate we will enable clustering so they
can talk to each other:

    vertx run eventbus_pointtopoint/Receiver.scala -cluster
    vertx run eventbus_pointtopoint/Sender.scala -cluster

## Event Bus Pub Sub

This examples shows how to use the event bus to do publish/subscribe messaging

A news item message is published every second by the Sender verticle on to the address 'news-feed'. This is the picked
up by any listenes on that address.

Run a few receivers and sender in different JVM instances. Since they are separate we will enable clustering so they
can talk to each other:

    vertx run eventbus_pubsub/Receiver.scala -cluster
    vertx run eventbus_pubsub/Receiver.scala -cluster
    vertx run eventbus_pubsub/Receiver.scala -cluster
    vertx run eventbus_pubsub/Sender.scala -cluster

## Simple Form

A simple http server example that handles form data.

To run the server:

    vertx run simpleform/SimpleFormServer.scala

Now access the form via your browser at <http://localhost:8080>

## Simple Form Upload

A simple http server example that handles file upload via a form

To run the server:

    vertx run simpleformupload/SimpleFormUploadServer.scala

Now access the form via your browser at <http://localhost:8080>
